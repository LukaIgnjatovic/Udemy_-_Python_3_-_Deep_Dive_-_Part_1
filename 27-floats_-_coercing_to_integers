# "trunc", "floor", and "ceil" methods from "math" module are going to be needed for some of the exercises in this example.
from math import trunc
from math import floor
from math import ceil

# "trunc" method truncates the value of a number to its nearest integer.
help(trunc)

# Its functionality can be seen in the next line of code.
print(trunc(10.3), trunc(10.5), trunc(10.9))

# "int" constructor uses truncation internally if the number is not an integer.
print(int(10.4))

# "floor" method returns the floor value of a number, the largest integer less than or equal to an input value.
help(floor)

# Its functionality can be seen in the next line of code.
print(floor(10.3), floor(10.5), floor(10.9))

# "trunc" and "floor" methods differ from each other when it comes to negative numbers.
print(trunc(-10.3), trunc(-10.5), trunc(-10.9))

print(floor(-10.3), floor(-10.5), floor(-10.9))

# "ceil" method returns the ceiling value of a number, the smallest integer greater than or equal to an input value.
help(ceil)

# Its functionality can be seen in the next line of code.
print(ceil(10.3), ceil(10.5), ceil(10.9))

# "ceil" method works with negative numbers as well.
print(ceil(-10.3), ceil(-10.5), ceil(-10.9))
